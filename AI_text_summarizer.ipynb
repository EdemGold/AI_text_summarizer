        "NFTs is an acronym which stand for Non Fungible Tokens(see why they shortened it?), and they are used to describe things which cannot be replaced as they special and have special properties like your computer, your favorite dress or your key holder.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Wikipedia, an NFT \"is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable.[1] NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple words, NFTs are digital assets which represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible collectible items. Collectibles here simply mean anything of value like maybe a painting by leonardo da vinci, a football signed by leo messi, the first apple 2 computer. things like that.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, NFTs are like digital certificates which show you own a particular item.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we understand the meaning of NFTs let's understand...\n",
        "\n",
        "How they Work\n",
        "NFTs exist on a blockchain, which are distributed ledgers that record transactions. Think of a blockchain as a database where you cannot easily manipulate the values. Blockchains are the underlying technology which powers crypto currencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you buy a collectible's NFT, it's just like getting a digital certificate saying you own that particular collectible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way, you and a group of other people all want a particular car(collectible) and you all bid for the car but then your price wins and you get the car. The people who were selling the car(creator of the collectible, like an artwork or something) give you a receipt proving you own the car(NFT), but to show it's real anyone can get a copy of the receipt given to you as proof that your bid got you the car(blockchain) but there will be something on you receipt which will differentiate your receipt from thee many others given to all those other people, that something serves as proof of your ownership of the car. So in case one of the many people who got the receipt want to get smart and claim they own the car(collectible) it won't stand.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, it's like one person having the Mona Lisa and others having copies of the Mona Lisa but not the real thing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most NFTs are hosted on the Ethereum blockchain and according to the Ethereum website, NFTs have some special properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "Each Token minted has a unique Identifier.\n",
        "They're not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 ETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn't the case with NFTs.\n",
        "Each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.\n",
        "They live on Ethereum and can be bought and sold on any Ethereum-based NFT market.\n",
        "In simpler words,\n",
        "\n",
        "If you own an NFT:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can easily prove you own it.\n",
        "No one can manipulate it in any way.\n",
        "You can sell it, and in some cases this will earn the original creator resale royalties.\n",
        "Or, you can hold it forever, resting comfortably knowing your asset is secured by your wallet on Ethereum.\n",
        "If you create an NFT:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can easily prove you're the creator.\n",
        "You determine the scarcity, because you determine how much of the NFT to give out.\n",
        "You can earn royalties every time it's sold.\n",
        "You can sell it on any NFT market or peer-to-peer. You're not locked in to any platform and you don't need anyone to intermediate.(put's art galleries out of the market ei😅)\n",
